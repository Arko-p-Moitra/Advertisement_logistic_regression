# Advertisement logistic Regression
This is a logistic regression problem where I have worked with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. I have created a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

Here I have read the data from a CSV file .

First of all I have done some data visualization with the help of "Matplotlib" and "Seaborn" to analyze the data visually.please find the images below,

I have used "Scikit Learn" libs to make the model,

And have used Scikit Learn libs to generate report matrices also,
